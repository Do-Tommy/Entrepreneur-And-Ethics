# Item 1: Business Plan 

## Company Name 

### EDITH GLASSES

## Long term vision statement
### 1. Expected goals?
#### The goal for our company is to create a pair of glasses that have a built in AI, like Alexa or Siri, to be able to advise the wearer on what they require. 
### 2. Where did the idea come from?
#### Our idea came from how technology has become easy to access, like smart watches that can monitor your heart rate, as well as keep track of your reminders. 
### 3. Questions that assist with our startup.
* What will this do to help?
* How can our startup impact the health of our users?
* Why we want to create this? 
 
#### What the glasses will do is provide a feature where an AI is linked with the glasses. With the built-in AI, the user will be able to do all the tasks that a normal AI, like Alexa or Siri, can do. We would have built in speakers near the back of the temples to communicate with the user, as well as a built-in microphone either at the base of the rims of the frame or the base of the nose pad. (We would have a built-in camera at the bridge of the glasses to monitor what the user can see.
#### Our technology glasses would help people by monitoring the sun rays’ effects to the eyes. After the glasses have calculated the sun ray’s harms to the eyes, it would dim the lens to appropriate levels for less strain to the eyes. With the smart glasses we would be able to monitor what the human eyes can see, and what is considered dangerous to the eyes. Our main goal is to ensure the safety of our users from the harms the sun can do to an individual. The built-in AI is an added extra that can help with quick references or help with planning a schedule. 
#### This is necessary to create because this invention will allow the public to understand the harms that the sun can do. The product will allow the user to adjust the shade of the lens but prior give a recommended amount of dimness for proper use.  This will also provide a way for people to privately listen to music. Although the speakers will be outside of the ears there would be a range of sound that only the wearer would be able to hear it.

## External opportunities ##
We imagine that our glasses will be able to pair with existing smart devices such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home or voice assistants such as Siri or Cortana. Our device will integrate with these systems so that it can use features attached to these systems, in the case of a smart home environment it will be able to do tasks like turning off the lights. One goal tied to this would be to get some kind of certification from the companies so that we can advertise our device as not only being compatible with these systems but also certified by the company.

## Strategy

### Our strategy for the next 3-5 years is to become a device that is used everyday like an apple watch.
* The objective for the next 3 - 5 years will be to have EDITH glasses a household staple in each American home. We want our company to expand and be integrated into smarthome devices such as your Amazon alexa speaker, Philips hue lights, and Nest thermostats. This company aims to be like your everyday sunglasses or a device that pairs well with your phone such as an Apple watch does and provide tools such as AR to display images in real time.
* A keystone that we will have is to have yearly sales be > 10 million EDITH glasses
* Increase customer retention after 6 months by 50%●Partner with 20 different companies
* To determine sales success we will be tracking the difference of what our target goal is to quarterly to see if we are on the right track to success
* For customer retention success will will get the amount of customers that have an EDITH account with us longer than 6 months
* The ratio of partner companies we have every year will determine if our key results are successful The main thing that will differentiate us from similar companies is making a smart glasses device meant for the everyday consumer. Other smart devices companies target company employees in order to improve their workflow and efficiency. Google glass markets their glasses towards warehouse workers and employees of the workforce in order to improve their productivity output by reducing the amount of devices they need. EDITH glasses will become an item that reduces your small tasks such as GPS directions, identifying restaurants with yelp, or simple item identification such as image search.

## Board 
A few people that we would like on board with us would be Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates. We believe that these three would be part of our board because they are all tech leaders in their own unique way.<br>
<br>    
A person for whom we want on our board would have to be Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg is the founder and Chief Executive Officer to Facebook, now known as Meta. Facebook changed its name to Meta because Zuckerberg is trying to (2)“usher in the metaverse, a new world built in virtual reality.” What virtual reality is, (3) “is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.” Zuckerberg created the Oculus, a head mounted display, to show the virtual reality. He also, recently said that (4)“Think about how many things that are in your life [that] don’t actually need to be physical and could be easily replaced by a digital hologram”. Stepping into the metaverse takes away the use of any digital things at home, like a tv and its programs. Essentially, what we are trying to do is implement his holograms on the go. This would be practical for our glasses because we envision outdoor use and having a virtual reality on the go.<br>    
<br> 
Another person that we deemed to be impactful for our company is Elon Musk. He is most well known for being the Chief Executive Officer for Tesla and Spacex. Tesla has an autopilot feature for vehicles that works by having (1)“built-in cameras and ultrasonic sensors to see and sense the environment around the car.” With the cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and virtual reality on our glasses we would be able to fuse both reality and virtual reality. What we are trying to do with our glasses is have several capabilities. If we were to use our glasses outdoors and have a hologram pop up within the lens, the cameras and sensors would detect the surroundings in case the user is in danger of hitting an object or going into oncoming traffic. In theory, this would be like using your cell phone on a walk, but with the glasses watching your surroundings for you. We believe with Musk’s help we would be able to improve our glasses technology immensely.<br>
<br>   
Our last choice for our board would be Bill Gates because in one of our previous PostU assignments, he was featured on taxing the robots. Bill Gates was the chief executive officer, chief software architect, and president of Microsoft. He understands the necessary actions needed to advance human equality as machines takes over the future. Bill Gates was able to create Microsoft a computer company and introduce it to the world. In a sense, Gates was the one to kick start the technology era and is now a philanthropist. We believe that Bill Gates is the one that could lead us onto the right track of morality in the tech industry. He would benefit our company greatly because his knowledge on software would assist critically for our glasses.<br>

# Item 4: Experimentation & Priorities 
## Experimentation 
1. As a cheap prototype design for our glasses we would use a normal pair of glasses, attach a separate device that can fit properly along the frame to show a separate visual display in front of the lens. 

2. We would use a software chip like Arduino, have an OLED display in front of the lens, setup a Bluetooth module to link a person’s phone so it can display the time, weather, and date. For this to be just a prototype we are expecting a button to turn on and off the display, that way it would not impair the individual’s sight. 

3. To further expand this product, we are hoping to add in a feature like Siri or Alexa. Similarly, we would have another button just like the display, but this would be used solely for Siri and Alexa. The microphone would be placed either under the frame or where the nose pads would be located, and we would have the speaker near the temple area of the frame. Again, we would have two other buttons to raise or lower the volume of the speakers. Since we are trying to make this a cheaply designed prototype everything would be considered clip-ons to the actual glasses frame. As we progress to our end result we hope to incorporate thinly designed frames that can hold all the components from within the glasses and hopefully evolve into touch button. 

4. Potential customers we will involve are most likely social media influencers. Many social media influencers tend to have a huge audience combined through multiple platforms such as Instagram , Twitter, Facebook and Tik Tok. We will also be able to involve potential customers by creating school events because there will be a large diverse group of people that can give good feedback. Every student loves free stuff.

5. To gauge our OKR and metrics, we will view the amount of users that click the social media influencers affiliate codes. We will monitor website traffic every time a social media post occurs to see if it reaches our goals. Measuring user signups will also be critical. Student interactions will also be a good measure since we are physically able to account for student signups.

## Priorities
We will first be testing how many people click on our influencer affiliate codes and we will monitor website traffic to determine whether our post meets our goals
